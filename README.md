using MS-Access as a front-end application against an Oracle database. 
creating views in Oracle as a mechanism to simplify application programming to show current values of fields, while keeping a history of changes to those fields in a set of tables in the Oracle database.
Also will be building a set of triggers that update the history tables for each insert, update, or deletion.  
The MS-Access forms can link either to the view (seeing the current version of all fields) or to the 
individual history tables for each of the fields that is chosen for having its changes recorded in the history tables.
